# Live-stock-analysis


Hi, In this project I have compared the stock pricing of the two famous American companies **Apple & Tesla** and represented them in a very easy to understand & visual manner. The data used in this project were extracted from finance.yahoo.com, this is a free website where the stock pricing of the listed companies are present.

**DATA EXTRACTION**:-
1) Go to finance.yahoo.com and in the search bar enter the name of the stock for which you would like to extract the data.
2) Click on the 'Historical Data' tab and downlaod the data ( you can set up the date range for which you would like to download the data)

**CALCULATIONS & GRAPH**:-
The data downloaded is in a very easy to undertand format, for the graph I have used the closing price of the respective comapnies in the first 2 sheets. In the 3rd sheet I have added a dropdown where in we can select the parameters using which we would like to compare the pricing.
I used the 'INDEX' and other complex yet very important function to calculate the values for the common paramters we use on a daily basis some of which are:-
1) **Open Price** of the stock on particular date
2) **Closing price** on a particular date
3) **Highest & Lowest price of the day** (usefull for Intraday Trading)
4) **52 Week High & Low price**.

Since this is a live stock monitoring project you can easily track the prices and manage your portfolio by simply downloading the latest data and copy paste in the sheet as it is. The formulas are written to handle this (using constant syntax) and I will be monitoring this for a week to ensure that the values are being calculated correctly once the updated data is entered.

**Benifits of this project**:-
1)This project is usefull in most of the cases specially if you are planning to invest in the US market as the prices have droped drastically (trust me this is the perfect time to invest in US market ;) ).
2) Using the analysis methods from this project you can compare the prices of competitor companies and the market trend in the particular segment.
3) If you are stock analyst of a company you can use this to take decisions or plan activities based on Data Driven Methods.

There are various improvements that I am planning to do in this project but if you identify any gaps or issues in my methods or any technical mistaked kindly let me know. 
Thank you
